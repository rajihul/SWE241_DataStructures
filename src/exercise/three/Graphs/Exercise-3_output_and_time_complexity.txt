1. Convert from adjacency matrix to adjacency list: 

	Vertex 0: 0 1 4 
	Vertex 1: 1 0 2 3 4 
	Vertex 2: 2 1 3 
	Vertex 3: 3 1 2 4 
	Vertex 4: 4 0 1 3 

	Time Complexity: O(N^2) becuase you have to linearly
	scan all elements of a NxN 2D adjacency matrix, 
	where N = number of vertices, and insert values 
	into Linked List in O(1) time.

2. Convert from adjacency list to an incidence matrix:

	1 	1 	0 	0 	0 	0 	0 
	1 	0 	1 	1 	1 	0 	0 
	0 	0 	1 	0 	0 	1 	0 
	0 	0 	0 	1 	0 	1 	1 
	0 	1 	0 	0 	1 	0 	1 

	Time Complexity: O(NxMxO) where N = # of vertices,
	M = max adjacent nodes and O = total # of edges

3. Convert from an incidence matrix to adjacency list 

	Vertex 0: 0 1 4 
	Vertex 1: 1 0 2 3 4 
	Vertex 2: 2 1 3 
	Vertex 3: 3 1 2 4 
	Vertex 4: 4 0 1 3 

	Time Complexity: O(NxM) becuase you have to linearly
	scan all elements of a NxM 2D incidence matrix, where
	N = # of vertices and M= # of edges in addition
	to inserting values into Linked List in O(1) time.
